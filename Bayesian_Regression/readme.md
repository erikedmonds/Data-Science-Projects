# My first foray into Uber's Pyro Library

  This is my first attempt at Uber's Probabilistic Programming Language, Pyro. 
It's a fantastic language, with PyTorch baked right in. 

  This program generates a fake sample dataset and applies a bayesian linear regression, using Pyro and 
Numpy.

  Note: I will also be adding a notebook to this project as well, and including visualizations with D3, just because 
its my favorite viz library.

## Requirements
  The requirements.txt file containts all the requirements, but there are not very many, as most are installed 
as dependencies for Pyro. The regression files are split into two modules, pyro_bayes, and pyro_linear.
